I want to make an application for writers of books.

What features do you recommend?

These are the ones that I need for sure.

1. The ability for the user to see how the text would look in the actual book. In other words, when they are writing, it would be as if they are wirting on a black book page. Not an infinate text scrolling down the page.

2. The user should have the ability to select which page to view, and which chapter to view. This would be some kind of pagination at the bottom of the UI.

3. THe user should be able to use voice-to-text to populate the text on the page.

4. The user should be able to a seperate section for brainstorming ideas. This would be a notepad with pages and should be able to save entries with a title of the idea and the date the idea was created.

5. The ability for the writer to write multiple books sumiltaniously. (The brainstroming notebook should be related only to the book it is created with

6. We must have an AI to to perform mutliple action, as an assitant to the writer. There must be a buttons which will allow the AI to do the following: 
a. Grammar Checker: Checks the grammar of the current page.
b. Idea generator: The AI should have the context of the entire book in a vector database which it references to generate ideas.
c. Ask: The user can ask questions about the book which the AI will answer.
d. Plot: This AI updates the plot as the writer progresses in wiriting the book. Things to consider: Characters, plot points, or even concepts. This should follow this discipline and be shown graphically and otherwise. @https://lancymccall.com/how-to-map-your-plot-with-the-7-point-plot-structure/
